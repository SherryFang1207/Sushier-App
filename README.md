## Design Idea & Process üé®

Sushier's design process was a meticulous blend of culinary artistry and modern user experience principles. Our aim was to create a platform that not only celebrates sushi traditions but also offers a seamless digital experience, powered by cutting-edge technologies.

### Design Inspiration üåü

In the initial stage, we drew inspiration from the elegance and beauty of sushi presentation. We scoured design reference websites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) for visual inspirations that informed our design choices.

**Recommended Tools**: Dribbble, Behance, Awwwards

### Wireframing and Prototyping ‚úèÔ∏è

To bring our vision to life, we utilized professional design tools such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This allowed us to create detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes that helped us plan the user interface and functionality with precision.

**Recommended Tools**: Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch

### Responsive Design üì±

Sushier's design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across a variety of devices. We employed technologies like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to craft customized, case-by-case screen dividing points in CSS. This attention to detail guarantees a flawless transition between different screen sizes.
