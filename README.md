## Design Idea & Process :art:

Sushier's UX/UI design follows modern user experience principles and uses the newest design tools to offer a seamless digital experience.

### Design Inspiration üåü

In the initial stage, we drew inspiration from the combination of Sushi and E-commerce online ordering. We scoured design reference websites like [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/) for visual inspirations that informed our design choices.

### Wireframing and Prototyping ‚úèÔ∏è

To bring our vision to life, we utilized professional design tools such as [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). This allowed us to create detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes that helped us plan the user interface and functionality with precision.

### Responsive Design üì±

Sushier's design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across a variety of devices. We employed technologies like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to craft customized, case-by-case screen breakpoints in CSS. This attention to detail guarantees a flawless transition between different screen sizes.
